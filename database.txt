What would your database be like in a real environment?

For the management of the rooms, I would use a relational database, e.g., mySQL or PostgreSQL.
It should have at least 4 tables that would have to relate with each other:
- Users
- Booking
- Rooms
- Bills

Users table:
-> user_id (PK NN AI int)
-> name (varchar)
-> surname (varchar)
-> email (varchar)
-> isAdmin (bool)

Booking table:
-> form_id (PK NN AI int)
-> checkIn (int)
-> checkOut (int)
-> peolple (int)
-> user_id (FK)

Rooms table:
-> roomNum (PK NN int)
-> people (int)
-> size (int)
-> isAvailable (bool)

Bills table:
-> bill_id (PK NN AI int)
-> price (int)
-> roomNum (FK)
-> user_id (FK)

PK = Primary Key
FK = Foreign Key
NN = NOT NULL
AI = AUTO_INCREMENT

The purpose of the database design is to organize and show the data in a simple and objective way.
Certainly a database for hotel management is larger and more complex than this one, but the more structured
and organized the database design is, the more we would avoid future problems.
